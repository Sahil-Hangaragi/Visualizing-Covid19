# 🦠 Visualizing COVID-19 Spread and Impact

This project aims to explore, visualize, and analyze the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using data science techniques and Python-based visualizations. It highlights key metrics like case counts, deaths, recoveries, and trends over time and geography.

## 📁 Project Overview

The notebook `visualizing-covid-19.ipynb` covers:

* **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**
* **Daily and cumulative cases**
* **Top affected countries**
* **Trend visualizations (time series)**
* **Bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps**
* **Optional: Geographic mapping (if used)**

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly (for interactive charts, if applicable)
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The data used is likely sourced from:

* Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data Repository
* [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
* WHO or Kaggle datasets

Common fields include:

* `date`, `country`, `confirmed`, `deaths`, `recovered`, `active`, etc.

## 📊 Key Insights

* Daily vs cumulative trends in global cases
* Country-wise comparison of confirmed and death counts
* Peak outbreak periods
* Recovery trends
* Visualization of how the pandemic evolved geographically

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open `visualizing-covid-19.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add animated visualizations over time
* Use GeoPandas or Folium for interactive maps
* Correlation analysis with population, density, vaccination rate, etc.
* Deploy to Streamlit or Dash as an interactive dashboard
